Guardian Content API for NodeJS
===============================

Setup
-----

This example uses NodeJS and a number of dependencies to demonstrate a simple example of retrieving content from the Guardian Content API and present that in a web page.  Dependencies are managed by [ndistro](https://github.com/visionmedia/ndistro) so should be easy to get started. Install ndistro as per instructions on that site and then run 'ndistro' on the command line.

This will set up the following dependencies:

 - connect, a HTTP middleware library
 - expressjs, a lightweight web framework
 - ejs, a rendering engine for HTML
 - node-properties, a small library to externalise configuration

Once ndisto has run the following directories will have been created: bin, lib and modules.  NodeJS is now setup locally and relative to the directory you are currently in.  

Running
-------

To run the web app, run the following command

	./bin/node index.js
	
If you have not changed any defaults, the web app will load on port 3000.

Usage
-----

You will be required to enter a name for your query and the URI for the query.  You can get the query URI by going to the [Content API Explorer](http://explorer.content.guardianapis.com).  Sign up for an account (without one, you can't get HTML from the API required for this app) and use the 'content' tab to build your query.

Notes
-----

There is no persistence in this application, so when you start the app no queries will have been remembered.
